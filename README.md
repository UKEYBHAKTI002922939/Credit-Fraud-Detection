## PaySim: A Mobile Money Transaction Simulator

This repository provides an implementation of **Credit Fraud Detection**, a model that simulates mobile money transactions based on a real dataset of financial logs from a mobile money service in Africa.

**Context:**

PaySim aims to provide researchers and developers with a realistic simulation environment for testing and evaluating algorithms and models related to mobile money transactions. The model is based on a sample of anonymized transactions extracted from a month of financial logs provided by a multinational company operating the mobile money service in over 14 countries.

**Models Implemented:**

This repository offers implementations of various machine learning algorithms for mobile money transaction simulation:

* **XGBoost:** This gradient boosting algorithm provides accurate and efficient modeling capabilities.
* **Linear Regression:** This simple model establishes a linear relationship between input features and transaction amounts.
* **Logistic Regression:** This model predicts the probability of a transaction occurring based on its attributes.
* **Random Forest:** This ensemble technique combines multiple decision trees, improving accuracy and reducing overfitting.

**Repository Contents:**

* **Simulation code:** Python scripts implementing the PaySim model with different algorithms.
* **Data preprocessing scripts:** Tools to prepare the real transaction data for model training.
* **Evaluation scripts:** Metrics to assess the performance of the simulation model.
* **Documentation:** Explanations of the data, models, and simulation process.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
3. Run the provided Python scripts to train and evaluate the PaySim model.
